# Thin wrapper around scripts/check_axiom_coverage.lean, the axiom-pinning coverage guard:
# every public theorem declared inside a MobiusCPT module must have a `#print axioms` line
# in scripts/print_axioms.lean (the append-only input to the live axiom audit run by
# scripts/check-axioms.sh). scripts/check.sh runs this immediately after that audit, under
# the same /tmp/lean-build.lock as the rest of the gate.
#
# Requires a completed `lake build` (scripts/check.sh orders this correctly). The pass/fail
# decision and the `MISSING: <name>` diagnostics are produced entirely by the Lean file
# itself (via `throwError`, which gives `lake env lean` a nonzero exit code); this wrapper
# only runs it and propagates that exit code.
